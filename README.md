# Interview Feedback Web App

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

A lightweight, anonymous feedback collection platform for job seekers to gather insights after interviews, mock interviews, or professional conversations. Built with C# (ASP.NET Razor Pages) and Supabase (PostgreSQL), this application is optimized for quick, low-effort responses to maximize participation from feedback providers.

> üìù **Note:** This project was created by Cathy as a learning exercise for C#, developed with the assistance of Cursor IDE and Claude-3.7-Sonnet AI.

## üöÄ Purpose

This application serves as a dedicated tool for job seekers to collect anonymous, constructive feedback from various sources. By removing identifying information and keeping the form short, it encourages honest responses from:

- Interviewers and HR professionals
- Mock interview partners
- Career advisors and professors
- Networking contacts
- Peers and colleagues

The anonymity and simplicity of the form (under 2 minutes to complete) help candidates gather valuable insights they might not otherwise receive through traditional channels.

## üéØ Features

- **Anonymous Submission**: No login required, completely private feedback
- **Role Selection**: Identify feedback provider type (Peer, HR, Professor, etc.)
- **Quick-Select Categories**:
  - Strengths (e.g., communication, technical knowledge)
  - Areas for improvement
  - Suggestions to increase hiring potential
- **Low-Friction Interface**: Primarily checkbox-based with minimal typing required
- **Optional Comments**: Space for additional context or personalized advice
- **Timestamp-Based Identification**: Each submission receives a unique ID based on submission time
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
- **Embeddable**: Can be integrated into personal websites or Google Sites via iframe
- **Data Ownership**: All feedback belongs to you, stored in your Supabase instance

## üíª Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core Razor Pages
- **Language**: C# (.NET 7.0+)
- **Styling**: CSS with responsive design principles
- **JavaScript**: Minimal JS for enhanced UI interactions

### Backend
- **API Integration**: Supabase REST API via HttpClient
- **Authentication**: Supabase API key authentication
- **Data Processing**: Server-side C# handling form submissions

### Database
- **Provider**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Data Structure**: Single-table design with arrays for categorical feedback
- **Security**: Row-level security policies via Supabase

### Development & Deployment
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Hosting Options**:
  - Replit (for development and testing)
  - Render (for production)
  - Microsoft Azure (for production)
- **Requirements**: HTTPS endpoint required for secure data transmission

## üèó Architecture & Design

The application follows a simple yet effective architecture:

1. **Frontend Layer**: Razor Pages provide the user interface and form handling
2. **Service Layer**: Handles communication with Supabase through REST API calls
3. **Data Layer**: Supabase PostgreSQL database stores all feedback entries

The design prioritizes:
- **Simplicity**: Minimal clicks to complete feedback
- **Anonymity**: No tracking or personal identifiers
- **Accessibility**: Works across devices and browsers
- **Performance**: Fast loading and submission times

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema

```sql
create table feedback (
  created_at timestamptz primary key default now(),
  feedback_provider_role text,
  strengths text[],             -- e.g., ['communication', 'clarity']
  improvements text[],          -- e.g., ['confidence', 'technical depth']
  hirable_suggestions text[],   -- e.g., ['more projects', 'stronger stories']
  comments text
);
```
